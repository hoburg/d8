Horizontal Tail Model
*********************

The purpose of the horizontal tail is threefold: to trim the aircraft for steady level flight,
to provide longitudinal stability, and to give the pilot pitch control authority
over a range of flight conditions. The horizontal tail model can configure both pi-tails
and conventional horizontal tails.

Model Assumptions
=================

We assume a constant taper, symmetric horizontal tail, with
a lift per unit span that is proportional to local chord. Furthermore, we assume that the horizontal
and vertical tail joint in a pi-tail is a pin joint, and therefore does not exert a moment on the
horizontal tail. We implement a conservative linearization of the shear and moment distributions to size
the structural members of the horizontal tail.
