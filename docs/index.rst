SPaircraft is a signomial programming compatible transonic aircraft conceptual design optimization tool.
It is of similar level of fidelity as TASOPT, and can perform the single- and multi-mission optimization of many
different configurations of aircraft.

Two papers on the development and advantages of SPaircraft are in the pre-print stage:

    * `Application of Signomial Programming to Aircraft Design
<http://hoburg.mit.edu/publications/spajoa_watermark.pdf>`_ motivates the use of signomial
programs in aircraft design, and describes the majority of the models
used in SPaircraft.

    * `Efficient and Reliable Aircraft Multidisciplinary
Design Optimization via Signomial Programming
<http://hoburg.mit.edu/publications/SP_tasopt_watermark.pdf>`_ extends these models to multiple
aircraft configurations, and demonstrates the advantages of SPaircraft relative to other existing
multidisciplinary design optimization tools.

This website is under construction, and may not reflect the most up-to-date models.
If you are not able to find answers to your questions in the documentation,
please feel free to post `issues <https://github.com/convexengineering/SPaircraft/issues>`_
and suggest areas for improvement.
