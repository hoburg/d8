Wing Model
**********
The aircraft wing is designed generate sufficient lift such that the aircraft can
takeoff, climb, cruise, descend, and land safely. Typically the wings also carry fuel tanks and
support the engines. Unfortunately, wings are heavy and produced drag. The purpose of this
model is to relate all of these considerations.

Model Assumptions
=================

The wing model assumes a continuous-taper, low-wing configuration with a modern transonic
airfoil. It does not currently consider wing twist or wing dihedral. It also does not consider roll or
yaw stability.
