Vertical Tail Model
***************
The purpose of an aircraft’s vertical tail is two-fold. Firstly, it must
provide stability in yaw. Secondly, it must provide adequate yaw control authority in critical flight
conditions. For a multi-engine aircraft, the critical flight condition is typically an engine failure
at low speeds. The vertical tail must be capable of providing sufficient sideforce in this case.
The vertical tail must also provide adequate yaw rate acceleration during landing flare in crosswind
conditions. The design of the vertical tail is therefore coupled to the size of the fuselage, the
position of the engines, and the aircraft’s moment of inertia.
